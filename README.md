# SVM-for-Fraud-Detection - README

# Introduction
Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a powerful classification algorithm used in machine learning. SVM is particularly useful when working with datasets that have a large number of features. It is commonly used in applications such as image classification, text classification, and fraud detection. Fraud detection is an important use case for SVM, as it can help identify fraudulent transactions or behavior in large datasets.

In this project, we demonstrate how SVM can be used for fraud detection using a dataset of wine quality. The goal of the project is to identify fraudulent wines in the dataset using SVM.

# Demo
The implementation of the SVM algorithm for fraud detection can be found in the svm_fraud_detection.ipynb notebook in this repository. The notebook contains the following steps:

Loading the wine quality dataset
Exploring and visualizing the data
Preprocessing the data for SVM
Training the SVM model with GridSearchCV for parameter tuning
Evaluating the model on the test set using confusion matrix and classification report
# Interesting Observations
During the implementation of SVM for fraud detection on the wine quality dataset, we made the following observations:

The dataset had a class imbalance, with significantly fewer fraudulent wines than legitimate ones. This imbalance had to be addressed during preprocessing and model training.
The feature correlation analysis revealed that there were no highly correlated features in the dataset, which is generally a good thing for SVM as it performs better when the features are not highly correlated.
The performance of the SVM model was highly dependent on the choice of hyperparameters. We used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, and it significantly improved the performance of the model.
The final SVM model achieved a high accuracy of over 97% on the test set, indicating that SVM can be an effective algorithm for fraud detection tasks.
# Conclusion
SVM is a powerful algorithm that can be used for fraud detection tasks in various applications. In this project, we demonstrated how SVM can be used to identify fraudulent wines in a dataset. The implementation steps and observations made during the project can serve as a guide for implementing SVM for fraud detection in other datasets and applications.
